* General
** Implement empty rows skipping
   Add a flag for 'dsv->scm' and 'dsv-string->scm' that tells the procedures
   to skip empty rows.
* Unix
* RFC 4180
** Probably commented lines should be handled somehow?
   Currently 'dsv->scm' and 'dsv-string->scm' procedures ignore specified
   'comment-symbol' if the 'format' is set to 'rfc4180.

   To my understanding, the RFC says nothing about comments inside a CSV data,
   but probaby it will be useful if we could somehow skip commented lines.
